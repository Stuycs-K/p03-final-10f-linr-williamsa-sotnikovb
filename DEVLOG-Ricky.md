### 2025-01-06 - Added the proposal, this devlog, and filled out the readme
We spent the whole period deciding our group and also organizing our repo, filling out what we want to do on the files, and giving a way to contact each other after school. 

### 2025-01-07 - Planned and brainstormed more with select, changed proposal and readme
We spent the rest of the period after the lesson deciding how our program's structure is going to be like with using select.
