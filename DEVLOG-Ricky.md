### 2026-01-06 - Added the proposal, this devlog, and filled out the readme
We spent the whole period deciding our group and also organizing our repo, filling out what we want to do on the files, and giving a way to contact each other after school.

### 2026-01-07 - Planned and brainstormed more with select, changed proposal and readme
We spent the rest of the period after the lesson deciding how our program's structure is going to be like with using select.

### 2026-01-08 - Lab 16 transfer to this repo
We spent the period moving lab16 work to this repo.

### 2026-01-09 - Finished print method for the client on the board
I spent most of the period coding a draft of the print method for the client that prints out the information of the board each time it is their turn.

### 2026-01-12 - Makefile and started clientLogic
I spent the day fixing the makefile so it also compiles client and not just the server. Also, I started on the clientLogic and the client.c to initiate and send information to the server.
