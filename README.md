### Project Description:

We are going to create a battleship board game using networking and semaphores.

### Instructions:

The user would first download the repo. It would include a saved csv file of all user's statistics. To run the program, the user would simply compile and run the executive file with the ip address to connect to a server.

The user would interact with the program by first choosing who they want to fight and then after deciding, they would be able to play the game. Terminal will print out the board and then the user could choose where they want to search for a battle ship.
